    <p class="pd-p">Siem Reap, 11-12 June 2024: Financial services, a priority sector for growth in Cambodia, are one of the sector-specific annexes in the ASEAN Trade in Services Agreement (ATISA) that came into force in 2021. A major feature of ATISA is the revamping of market access from a positive to a negative-list scheduling approach. Under the agreement, Cambodia has 13 years to complete its negative list and schedule of non-conforming measures (NCMs) from their current AFAS Schedules of Commitments.</p>
